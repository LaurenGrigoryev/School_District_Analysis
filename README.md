# An Analysis of the School District

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to remove questionable reading and math scores from the school district's data set for all high schools by replacing the questionable scores with NaN. The reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School may have been the result of academic dishonesty. Once I cleaned the data of potentially fraudulent grades, the school board was able to uphold state-testing standards.

## Results

### * How is the district summary affected?
The district summary has a more accurate portrayal of percentage of students passing reading and math, but it showed a slightly lower passing rate. For example, the overall passing rate that included scores from Thomas High School ninth graders was about [65.2%](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-03%20(3).png), but the overall passing rate changes once the Thomas High School ninth grader schools were replaced with NaN, dropping slightly to [64.9%](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-03%20(2).png).

### * How is the school summary affected?
The summary for Thomas High School is affected by the passing rate rising once the ninth grade scores were replaced with NaN and removed.   

### *How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The replacement shows Thomas High School performing at a higher level than previously believed, which places its performance relative to other schools further up.

### * How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
The top five schools remain in the top five for reading and math scores. 

#### Scores by school spending

#### Scores by school size

#### Scores by school type

## Summary
Four major changes affected by replacing Thomas High School ninth grade score are that the overall passing rate for the district dropped, the overall passing rate for Thomas High School went up once the ninth grade scores were removed, and the passing rates of Thomas High School math score and the Thomas High School reading scores also went up.
