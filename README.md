# An Analysis of the School District

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to remove questionable reading and math scores from the school district's data set for all high schools by replacing the questionable scores with NaN. The reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School may have been the result of academic dishonesty. Once I cleaned the data of potentially fraudulent grades, the school board was able to uphold state-testing standards.

## Results

### * How is the district summary affected?
The district summary has a more accurate portrayal of percentage of students passing reading and math, but it showed a slightly lower passing rate. For example, the overall passing rate that included scores from Thomas High School ninth graders was about [65.2%](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-03%20(3).png), but the overall passing rate changes once the Thomas High School ninth grader schools were replaced with NaN, dropping slightly to [64.9%](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-03%20(2).png).

### * How is the school summary affected?
The summary for Thomas High School is affected by the passing rate also dropping once the ninth grade scores were replaced with NaN.  

### *How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The replacement shows Thomas High School performing at a lower level than previously believed, which places its performance relative to other schools further down.

### * How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
  
Scores by school spending

Scores by school size

Scores by school type
